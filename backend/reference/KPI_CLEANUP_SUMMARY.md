# Cleanup Summary - KPI Services Organization

## Files Removed from Active Services Directory

The following duplicate and backup files were found in `backend/src/services/` and moved to `backend/reference/backup_services/`:

### Removed Files:
1. **KpiService-backup.js** (383 lines)
   - Identical to KpiService-original.js
   - Comprehensive class-based implementation
   - Contained methods: calculateRetirementAge, predictTotalCorpus, calculateRetirementReadiness, generateRecommendations, calculateMemberKPIs, etc.

2. **KpiService-original.js** (383 lines)
   - Identical to KpiService-backup.js (confirmed via diff)
   - Complete implementation with all methods

3. **KpiService-new.js** (319 lines)
   - Similar implementation to backup/original
   - Slightly different structure but same functionality

4. **KpiService-test.js** (7 lines)
   - Simple test stub with only a test() method
   - Not used in production code

### Kept Active:
- **KpiService.js** (77 lines)
  - Currently imported and used by `backend/src/routes/kpi.js`
  - Contains the three methods required by the route:
    - `calculateRetirementAge()`
    - `predictTotalCorpus()`
    - `calculateRetirementReadiness()`
  - Functional and syntax-verified
  - Exports correctly as ES module

## Route Dependencies Verified

The KPI routes (`backend/src/routes/kpi.js`) successfully import and use:
- `KpiService.calculateRetirementAge()` - Line 119
- `KpiService.predictTotalCorpus()` - Line 240  
- `KpiService.calculateRetirementReadiness()` - Line 350

All method calls confirmed to work with the active KpiService.js implementation.

## Backup Location

All removed files are preserved in: `backend/reference/backup_services/`

This ensures they can be restored if needed while keeping the active services directory clean and organized.

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

- Services directory cleaned and organized
- No duplicate or backup files in active code
- All route dependencies verified and working
- Backup files safely preserved for reference
