## 🎯 Model Functionality Test

### Successful Operations
- ✅ `PensionData.count()` - Returns accurate record counts
- ✅ `PensionData.findByCountry()` - Filters by country (tested with Canada: 104 records)
- ✅ `PensionData.findByUserId()` - Retrieves individual records with all fields
- ✅ `PensionData.getStatistics()` - Comprehensive analytics working
- ✅ All new columns accessible through model instances

### Sample Data Access
```javascript
const member = await PensionData.findByUserId('U1000');
// Returns complete record with:
// - survivor_benefits: "Yes"
// - transaction_id: "f3e3a449-5731-4bfa-8195-e3bb191ab167"
// - financial_goals: "Legacy Planning"
// - insurance_coverage: "Yes"
// - device_id: "549227c9-cc8c-4902-b7d1-651e3c196dc4"
// - account_age: 19 days
```
