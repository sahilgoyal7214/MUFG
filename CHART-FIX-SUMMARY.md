# Chart Plotting Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem Identified
When plotting a line chart with `x=age` and `y=expected_amount_payout`, the chart was not rendering because:

1. **Missing Data Field**: The field `expected_amount_payout` didn't exist in the mock data
2. **Missing Variable Mapping**: No display name was configured for this field
3. **Invalid Data Handling**: Chart rendering failed silently when data was invalid

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Mock Data Generation
**File**: `frontend/src/components/roles/MemberContent.js`

**Added new calculated fields to mock data**:
```javascript
// NEW: Calculate expected annual payout (4% withdrawal rule)
const expectedAnnualPayout = projectedPensionAmount * 0.04;

// NEW: Calculate expected amount payout (total over retirement)
const expectedLifespanAfterRetirement = 20; // Assume 20 years in retirement
const expectedAmountPayout = expectedAnnualPayout * expectedLifespanAfterRetirement;
```

**Result**: Mock data now includes:
- `expected_annual_payout`: Annual withdrawal amount (4% rule)
- `expected_amount_payout`: Total expected withdrawal over retirement

### 2. Updated Variable Names Mapping
**Added display names for new fields**:
```javascript
expected_annual_payout: 'Expected Annual Payout',
expected_amount_payout: 'Expected Total Payout'
```

### 3. Improved Chart Data Validation
**Enhanced error handling in chart rendering**:
- Added validation for undefined/null data values
- Better filtering of invalid data points
- Improved console logging for debugging

### 4. Added Debug Logging
**Enhanced Add Chart function with comprehensive logging**:
```javascript
console.log('🎯 Add Chart clicked!', { chartId, loading, dataLength: data.length });
console.log('📊 Numeric columns found:', numericColumns);
console.log('⚙️ Setting chart config:', { defaultX, defaultY, chartId });
console.log('🔓 Opening config modal...');
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test the Fix
1. **Open the application**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Login as a member** (role: member)
3. **Navigate to Charts tab**
4. **Click "Add Chart"** - Should open configuration modal
5. **Set configuration**:
   - X-axis: `age` 
   - Y-axis: `expected_amount_payout`
   - Chart type: `line`
6. **Save configuration**
7. **Verify**: Line chart should now render properly

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Chart configuration modal opens when clicking "Add Chart"
- ✅ Both `age` and `expected_amount_payout` appear in dropdown options
- ✅ Line chart renders with connected data points
- ✅ Chart shows age (25-65) vs expected total payout amounts
- ✅ Data points are sorted by age for proper line progression

### Debug Information
- **Browser Console**: Check for debug logs starting with 🎯, 📊, ⚙️, 🔓
- **Network Tab**: Monitor API calls for data loading
- **React DevTools**: Inspect component state for `gridCharts`, `data`, `showConfigModal`

## 📊 Available Chart Fields

### New Fields Added:
- `expected_annual_payout`: Expected annual withdrawal (4% of total pension)
- `expected_amount_payout`: Total expected withdrawal over retirement

### Existing Fields:
- `age`: Member's current age
- `projected_pension_amount`: Projected total pension at retirement
- `annual_income`: Current annual income
- `contribution_amount`: Annual contribution
- `annual_return_rate`: Expected annual return percentage
- `years_contributed`: Years already contributed
- `employer_contribution`: Employer's contribution amount
- `total_annual_contribution`: Total annual contribution (member + employer)

## 🚀 Current Status
- ✅ Backend running on port 4000
- ✅ Frontend running on port 3000 with hot reload
- ✅ Mock data enhanced with new fields
- ✅ Chart rendering improved with better error handling
- ✅ Debug logging added for troubleshooting
- ✅ Ready for testing!

## 🔧 Next Steps
1. Test the line chart functionality
2. Verify other chart types still work (scatter, bar, histogram)
3. Test with different field combinations
4. Remove debug logging once confirmed working
